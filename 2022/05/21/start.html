  <h1>Starting this digital garden</h1>

  <p>Honestly, starting something like a blog or a digital garden myself used to be something that I never thought about; For me, doing it just seems to be a lot of extra work, with nothing really as a reward for the effort. Yet, here I am, years later, writing my first ever post.</p>

<p>Why? Well, I discovered during my work that, most of the problems and things that I encountered are quite similar in nature, and as such I usually need to refer back to the same docs, articles or code over and over again, often wasting a lot of time to relocate them. Keeping another set of internal documentation became neccessary to ensure me and everyone else in my team can quickly get the information that they need to resolve similar problems quickly.</p>

<p>However, I realised that much of this documentation are actually quite generic in nature, and can be applied to different domains. As such this became the main reasons for the birth of this digital garden, so that I could easily refer back to it.</p>

<p>At the same time, I want to use this space as well to record some of my thoughts, ideas, and even self study notes, mainly for myself, but at the same time, to share it with whomever may find it useful. Maybe there can even be some discussions about these topics.</p>

<p>This is a digital garden born out of my selfish desire. But who knows, maybe the sight of it may make someone else’s day.</p>

<p>See ya soon.</p>
